#FunStay - Experience Authentic Homestay Experience

Hello! This project is a college assignment given by our lecturer. FunStay is a web-based application, meant to promote homestay experience in Indonesia toward tourists; local or abroad. Just like most tour-web-based-services out there, FunStay allows user to book homestays around Indonesia. The booking process starts from user filling their personal informations, payment methods, and selecting their date. Aside that, FunStay also offers blogging platforms, to encourage bloggers around the world to share their experience in using FunStay. Here, content creators can post various contents like; photographs, culinary, culture and adventure stories from their experience using FunStay. This helps users to get a bigger picture on how is it using FunStay to explore and experience homestay.
